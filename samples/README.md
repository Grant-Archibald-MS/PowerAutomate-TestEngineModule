# Overview

These samples are provided to validate the functionality of the test engine modules to perform local loop unit tests

- [Basic](./basic/README.md) - Provides minimal example to setup Mocks, Trigger a Cloud flow and assert the results
- [Expression](./expression/testPlan.fx.yaml) - Explores to to verify the results of expressions. Useful as expressions ofen used to control logic and parameters for connectors
- [If](./if/testPlan.fx.yaml) - Explore the ability to evaluate boolen expressions to validate the actions
- [Loop](./loop/testPlan.fx.yaml) - Explore the the ability to execute loops
- [While](./while/testPlan.fx.yaml) - Explore the ability to keep excuting actions until loop condition is false
